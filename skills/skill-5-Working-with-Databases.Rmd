In this module we are going to cover the somewhat 'advanced' data import methods of connecting to remote databases. 

# {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

## Packages and Data {.tabset}

### Packages

```{r, echo=F, warning=F}
library(RMySQL)
library(DBI)
library(dplyr)
library(here)
library(RODBC)
```

### Data

The data for this example will be imported directly from the cloud hosted database.

## Background {.tabset}

### Roadmap

The overarching organization of this lesson is as follows:

1. I have an illustration of how to extract data from a MySQL database using the ```dbConnect()``` method from the [DBI](https://db.rstudio.com/getting-started/connect-to-database/) package. This illustration requires downloading a ```MySQL``` driver from the [RMySQL](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RMySQL/index.html) package.

2. I have a short abstract discussion of using the [RODBC](https://www.r-bloggers.com/connecting-r-to-an-oracle-database/) package to extract data from an Oracle Database. This is abstract because the Oracle Database that I work with is highly confidential and I can't allow others to access it.

3. I have provided some resources to help with the various issues generally encountered when trying to set up an R-Database pipeline.


### General Background

First, all I mean by 'remote' is not something stored on your local machine. In my work there are three flavors of remote database connections I work with:

1. Databases living on a SQL Server inside the SWFSC.
2. Databases maintained by PacFIN (most of you also probably get data from one of the "FINS")
3. Cloud databases I maintain in a virtual private cloud using Amazon Web Services

For this module we are going to work backwards from #3. This is because I can actually give everybody access to my Amazon databases. 

### Specific 

Here is some background that is somewhat interesting but not critical to understanding data import methods.

The public database used in ```Example 1``` contains locations and quantities of needles picked up in Santa Cruz, CA by public employees. Basically, I went to the City of Santa Cruz and asked for all the data they had on used hypodermic needles found in public spaces. They gave me a set of logs kept by Parks and Recreation, Public Works, and a few other departments. I transcribed these into a set of .csv files. 

I then created a MySQL database instance in the Amazon RDS cloud hosting service. I used a MySQL Client called MySQL Workbench to connect to this database and upload the needle log .csv files to the MySQL database instance. 

This database has two tables: ```needle_events``` and ```locations_geo```. When we query these tables in ```Example 1``` we get:

1. A data frame called "needles". This is a log of hypodermic needles picked up by Santa Cruz City Workers. Each observation is a "needle encounter" and include a date, location, quantity, and identifier for the muncipal department involved in the "encounter"

2. A data frame called "geos". This is a look-up table I created with (somewhat) precise geo-referencing for the locations recorded on the needle logs.

## Example 1:Public AWS Database {.tabset}

I'm going to do this is kind of reverse order and put the fun code part first...then I'll try to explain some less fun details later:

### Data Pull

```{r}
cn <- dbConnect(drv      = RMySQL::MySQL(), 
                username = "admin", 
                password = "nmfssocialscience", 
                host     = "mams-teaching-public.c65i4tmttvql.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com", 
                port     = 3306, 
                dbname   = "needle_waste")
dbListTables(cn)
```


```{r}
needles <- tbl(cn, "needle_events")
needles <- tbl_df(needles)

```


If (probably a big if) the stars have aligned for us and everybody was able to execute that code chunk then here is a snippet of what we should have:

```{r}
head(needles)
```

Example of a simple SQL query to retreive only certain observations from the ```needle_events``` table:

```{r}
query.result <- dbGetQuery(cn, "SELECT * FROM needle_events where NEEDLE_QUANTITY>1")
head(query.result)
```


```{r}
geos <- tbl(cn, "locations_geo")
geos <- tbl_df(geos)
head(geos)
```

Here's an example of how we could execute an inner join using both the ```needle_events``` and ```locations_geo``` tables:

```{r}
df.joined <- dbGetQuery(cn, "SELECT * FROM needle_events inner join locations_geo on needle_events.LOCATION_RECORDED=locations_geo.LOCATION_RECORDED")
head(df.joined)
```

* *needles* is a database table I constructed using logs that Santa Cruz city workers are required to fill out when they pick up a used hypodermic needle.
* *geos* is a database table I constructed with geo-referenced coordinates for each 'place' in the *needles* table.

### Step-by-Step

For most database connections we need a few things:

* a driver 
* a datasource
* some connection credentials/details

#### Driver

A database driver is just a program that implements a protocol for a database connection. A Database Management System (DBMS) needs an adapter program (a driver) to enable other systems to connect to it. In this case, I am using the MySQL Database Management System so we need a MySQL driver to connect to this database. This example is relatively simple because the MySQL database driver is contained inside the R Package [RMySQL](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RMySQL/index.html). We provide this driver as an argument to the dbConnect() method.

```{r eval=F}
dbConnect(drv = RMySQL::MySQL(),...)

```

In the appendix, we provide examples of connection strings for some other DBMS with other drivers.

#### Data Source

In this case, the data source is just the database endpoint. For some database connection applications, specifying the data source an be a little tricky...but for this one it's pretty straight forward.

```{r eval=F}
dbConnect(drv = RMySQL::MySQL(),...,
          host="mams-teaching-public.c65i4tmttvql.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com")

```

This next part is not crucial for you all to know but it's relevant. I got the database endpoint for this application by looking at the *Connectivity and Security* tab of my AWS RDS portol:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here('figures/aws-rds-dashboard.png'))
knitr::include_graphics(here('figures/aws-rds-endpoint.png'))
```

#### Connection Credentials/Details

The remaining arguments provided to the dbConnect() method are:

* username/password: in the case of accessing remote databases maintained by others these will probably be managed for you by the DBAs.
* port: sometimes you will need to provide this (see the AWS dashboard figure above) but other times it will be mapped through a configuration file (see Appendix)
* database name: in this case the host location is a cloud hosted database instance which is capable of hosting many different databases. Since the database name may not be unique to endpoint, we have to tell the server which database on this host we want to connect to.

## Appendix: An Oracle DB Example

This part won't be executable for anyone that doesn't already have a PacFIN connection. I wanted to present it here in order to highlight some of the more annoying issues that one often encounteres when trying to connect R to a remote database.

On the West Coast, commercial fishing landing receipts (fish tickets) and groundfish trawl logbooks are collected by the state fish and game agencies. They are curated by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission and made available to NMFS through a database called PacFIN.

PacFIN use the Oracle Database Engine to power it's data warehouse. Technically, it is 100% possible to connect to PacFIN and bring commercial fish ticket data directly into an R workspace...practically, it's a pain.

Here are the steps:

1. First, one needs to have an Oracle Database Client installed on their computer (I am currently using the Oracle OraClient11g client)

2. One also needs to have a configuration file (tnsnames.ora) saved in specific directory.

3. One needs the Database Adminstrators at PacFIN to allow them access. This involves:
    * providing the DBAs with a static IP address so they can allow you past the firewall
    * obtaining login credentials from the DBAs
    
4. For windows users (which is most people in the federal government) wishing to connect through Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) protocols, you may need to engage your IT person for adminstrative access in order to set a Data Source Name in the Windows Data Source Adminstrator Program. Note: there is an alternative that I will discuss below.

It is notable that basically all of these steps involve relying on someone else to do stuff for you. Because of this, I found the process of getting an Oracle DB connection set-up to be pretty frustrating.

### The Oracle Connection

Here's an example of connection string that I use to pull data from our region commercial fishing warehouse, PacFIN: 

```{r eval=F}
library(DBI)
library(RODBC)

channel.pacfin = odbcDriverConnect("Driver={Oracle in OraClient11g_home2}; Dbq=pacfin; Uid=; Pwd=;",believeNRows=FALSE)
df <- sqlQuery("select * from pacfin_marts.comprehensive_ft where pacfin_year = 2018")

```

In item #4 above I mentioned that there is a way around setting up a DSN in the Windows ODBC menu. I know this because, to this day, I still have not gotten our IT person to grant me adminstrative access to my computer long enough to set up a Windows DSN for my PacFIN connection.

The alternative is to use TNS (transparent networks substrate) protocol rather than ODBC to resolve the database host. For R users this is really just the difference between using *odbcDriverConnect()* and *odbcConnect()*.

One thing to notice about the connection string above is that it is pretty minimal. Because it points R to the Oracle Client, the *odbcDriverConnect()* method doesn't require a lot of extra arguments like hostname or port number. This because much of the information required to establish a connection with the Oracle Database is contained in the configuration file (tnsnames.ora) that supports the Oracle Client.

The following is an example of the tnsnames.ora configuration file that I have installed alongside my Oracle Client. Note that this configuration file provides the host name and port number for the connection.


```{r eval=F}
PACFIN =

  (DESCRIPTION =

    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = hostname.host.org)(PORT = port))

    (CONNECT_DATA =

      (SERVER = DEDICATED)

      (SERVICE_NAME = pacfin.psmfc.org)

    )

  )
```
